# Font “For Drawing Titles”
The font “For Drawing Titles” mimics the poster titles drawn by hand.
But it is not very hand-made – the outlines are clean.
The font has five different weights – light, regular, semi-bold, bold and black.
The weight changes the visual appearance but not the width or height of symbols.
So the text written using the black weight takes the same space as written using light weight.

As the font name suggests, it's suitable for large font size not for
small ones.

Fonts are drawn with «[FontForge](https://fontforge.org/)».
